This plugin will partially fix the UI of this game and make it playable with UEVR.

**Installing the plugin is very simple.**
- Just download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/mirudo2/WuWa-UI-Fix-for-UEVR/releases).
- Extract the downloaded file to `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\UnrealVRMod`, after that the profile was successfully installed.
> Tip: if you are not seeing the **AppData** folder, it means that it is hidden. Just enable/show hidden files and folders in the `Explorer` settings.
